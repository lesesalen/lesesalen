# Your opportunity to get a free lesesalen sticker!

It's finally here! You can now get your very own sticker from www.lesesalen.com, to get this you need to be one of the first 10 to make a pull request to this website. It can be small or big, doesn't matter. You can look at the list of issues in the github repo if you need ideas on what to do.

## I have already done a pull request, can I get mine now?

Yes, I will however not be able to send them, so you will have to collect them at lesesalen. If you have successfully merged a pull request in the past, then you have a sticker with your name on it. So for everyone else; hurry up, we are running out!

This weirdly enough aligns pretty well with hacktober, look it up if you want the free t-shirt from DigitalOcean.

_NOTE: This only applies to pull requests, not posts submitted in "rett frå kassa"_
