Lesesalen has some unique components that allow you to express yourself further when writing notes. This is a collection of them so you can try them out and understand how they work.

## Terminal

import Terminal from "../../../src/components/noteComponents/Terminal.tsx";

The terminal component is used for everything that you need to type into the terminal (you can also use it as a way to display output or anything else for that matter).

<Terminal title="This is a terminal with a title">
  Just some standard console output lmao
</Terminal>

<Terminal runline="./time_to_catch_python.py">
  this python script is so cool whoo
</Terminal>

<Terminal
  title="This is a terminal with a title and a command"
  runline="./time_to_catch_python.py"
>
  this python script is so cool whoo
</Terminal>

### How to use it

You can simply write the code below into your $.mdx$ file and you are all set.

```js
import Terminal from "../../../src/components/noteComponents/Terminal.tsx"

<Terminal title="this is not working">
Just some standard console output lmao
</Terminal>

<Terminal runline="./time_to_catch_python.py">
this python script is so cool whoo
</Terminal>

<Terminal title="This is a terminal with a title and a command" runline="./time_to_catch_python.py">
  this python script is so cool whoo
</Terminal>
```

### Props

- _title_ - Window title of the terminal.
- _runline_ - Commandline, if you hate the name, make a pullrequest.
