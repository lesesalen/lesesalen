import Terminal from "../../../src/components/noteComponents/Terminal.tsx";

Lesesalen has some unique components that allow you to express yourself further when writing notes. This is a collection of them so you can try them out and understand how they work.

## Terminal

The terminal component is used for everything that you need to type into the terminal (you can also use it as a way to display output or anything else for that matter).

<Terminal nowrap title="This is a terminal with a title">
  Just some standard console output lmao Just some standard console output lmao
  Just some standard console output lmao Just some standard console output lmao
  Just some standard console output lmao Just some standard console output lmao
  Just some standard console output lmao
</Terminal>

<Terminal title="This is a terminal with a title">
  Just some standard console output lmao Just some standard console output lmao
  Just some standard console output lmao Just some standard console output lmao
  Just some standard console output lmao Just some standard console output lmao
  Just some standard console output lmao
</Terminal>

<Terminal runline="./time_to_catch_python.py">
  this python script is so cool whoo
</Terminal>

<Terminal
  title="This is a terminal with a title and a command"
  runline="./time_to_catch_python.py"
>
  this python script is so cool whoo
</Terminal>

### How to use it

You can simply write the code below into your $.mdx$ file and you are all set.

```js
import Terminal from "../../../src/components/noteComponents/Terminal.tsx"


<Terminal nowrap title="this is not working">
